# kendy
A python script about a robot named Kendy

    print("Hello, I am Kendy!")
    #print("")
    print("I am developing and evolving into the following :")
    print("")
    print(" A) A program which will eventully encapsulate a D.A.I.S.E")
    print(" [Pronounced as Daisy](Digital Artificial Intelligent Sentient Entity) core.")
    print(" B) A physical construct to house a D.A.I.S.E. core and all relevant components. ")
    print(" C) A physical Robot/Android containing the D.A.I.S.E. core and all relevant components. ")
    This is a script for my robot core and how it starts up.
    Obviously it is a game and a work in progress :)
